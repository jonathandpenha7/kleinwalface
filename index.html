    <p id="message">
      I know I hurt you. And what hurts me even more is knowing I can’t hold you right now and say these words face-to-face.<br><br>
      Long distance has made this harder, but it hasn’t changed one thing: how much I love you.<br><br>
      You are the most precious part of my world — the softness in my day, the peace in my chaos, the warmth I wish I could reach through this screen and touch right now.<br><br>
      I’m not perfect. But I promise I’m trying, learning, and growing — for you, for us.<br><br>
      Will you let your Kleinwalface try again?
