    <h1>I know I hurt you 😞</h1>
    <p>
      What I said wasn’t fair. I acted out of frustration, but that’s no excuse.<br><br>
      You didn’t deserve those words — especially not from someone who loves you this much.<br><br>
      If your answer is “not now,” I understand. I just hope when you're ready, you'll let me try again… with more love, more patience, and the respect you always deserved. 🤍
